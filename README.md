# Personalized-Chatbot-Mimicking-Me-with-AI

Welcome to the Personalized Chatbot project! This repository contains the code and resources needed to develop a chatbot that can mimic your persona using AI technologies such as LLAMA2, AutoGPTQ, LangChain, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The chatbot is designed to accurately respond to queries about you by using "Act as" prompting, making it an effective simulation of your responses.

## Features
**Personalized Responses:** The chatbot mimics your persona using detailed "Act as" prompts.

**Advanced AI Models:** Utilizes LLAMA2 and AutoGPTQ for natural language understanding and generation.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Enhances the chatbot's responses by retrieving relevant information from a predefined knowledge base before generating an answer.

**Flexible Integration:** Built with LangChain for easy integration and scalability.

**Customizable:** Easily update the chatbot's knowledge base and behavior to reflect changes in personal information or preferences.

## Technologies Used
**LLAMA2:** A powerful language model from Meta for generating human-like text.

**AutoGPTQ:** A tool for fine-tuning and optimizing GPT models for specific tasks.

**HuggingFace:** A popular library for natural language processing and model hosting.

**LangChain:** A framework for developing applications with large language models.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines retrieval of relevant documents with generative AI for more accurate and context-aware responses.
